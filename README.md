### Abstract
N-staging is a determining factor for prognostic assessment and decision-making for stage-based cancer therapeutic strategies. Visual inspection of whole-slides of intact lymph nodes is currently the main method used by pathologists to calculate the number of metastatic lymph nodes (MLNs). Moreover, even at the same N stage, the outcome of patients varies dramatically. Here, we propose a deep-learning framework for analyzing lymph node whole-slide images (WSIs) to identify lymph nodes and tumor regions, and then to uncover tumor-area-to-MLN-area ratio (T/MLN). After training, our modelâ€™s tumor detection performance was comparable to that of experienced pathologists and achieved similar performance on two independent gastric cancer validation cohorts. Further, we demonstrate that T/MLN is an interpretable independent prognostic factor. These !ndings indicate that deep-learning models could assist not only pathologists in detecting lymph nodes with metastases but also oncologists in exploring new prognostic factors, especially those that are dif!cult to calculate manually.

### Demo

#### Train Segmentation model

##### train model

```
python ./segmentation/bin/train.py 
```
##### test model
```
python ./segmentation/bin/test.py 
```
#### Train Classification model
##### train model
```
python ./classification/bin/train.py 
```
##### test model
```
python ./classification/bin/test.py 
```
#### Get T/MLN

```
python ./test/bin/get_T_MLN.py --wsi_path './tiff/test_patients/'
```

where --wsi_path is the path to all the WSI tiff of the patient you are interested.
